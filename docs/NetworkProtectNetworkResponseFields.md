Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | A read-only unique identifier for a Network Protect resource. | [readonly]
**created_at** | **Date** | An ISO 8601 timestamp in UTC. | [readonly]
**updated_at** | **Date** | An ISO 8601 timestamp in UTC. | [readonly]
**roa_status** | [**NetworkProtectRoaStatus**](NetworkProtectRoaStatus.md) |  | [optional]
**roa_checked_at** | **Date** | When Fastly last completed a ROA check. Null while the status is pending. A failed check leaves this unchanged; an old value can indicate delayed or failing checks. Null also means the controller did not report a check time. | [optional] [readonly]
**roa_data_as_of** | **Date** | When the RPKI dataset used by the last check was built. This is not the same as `roa_checked_at`; a recent check can use an older dataset. Null while the status is pending or when no dataset build time was reported. | [optional] [readonly]
**loa_status** | [**NetworkProtectLoaStatus**](NetworkProtectLoaStatus.md) |  | [optional]
