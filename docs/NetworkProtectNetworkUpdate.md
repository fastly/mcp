# Fastly.NetworkProtectNetworkUpdate

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**description** | **String** | Optional descriptive text for the network. This metadata does not change traffic handling. Null clears it on update. | [optional]
**name** | **String** | A human-readable name, unique within the customer. | [optional]
**rule_set_id** | **String** | Custom rule-set attachment is unavailable. Omission, null, and an empty string preserve the current backend-assigned rule set. | [optional]
**endpoint_policies** | [**[NetworkProtectEndpointPolicy]**](NetworkProtectEndpointPolicy.md) | Complete endpoint policy configuration. A network has at most one policy per region and may have no policies. | [optional]
**advertise** | **Boolean** | Desired advertisement state, which is not the same as observed route state. Enabling it requires approved LOA, valid ROA, and a ready default-region delivery policy. A later ROA failure does not turn an existing advertisement off; losing LOA approval or the last ready default endpoint does. | [optional]  [defaults to false]
