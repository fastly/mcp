# Fastly.NetworkProtectRule

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ip_protocol** | [**NetworkProtectRuleIpProtocol**](NetworkProtectRuleIpProtocol.md) |  |
**source_prefix_list_id** | **String** | Match traffic whose source appears in this prefix list. |
**destination_ip_address** | **String** | Match traffic sent to this address; omit for any destination. An address outside a Network using this Rule Set never matches and still consumes one of the 64 rules. The API does not enforce containment in a network prefix; attached Rule Sets require a compatible IP family. |
**source_ports** | [**NetworkProtectRuleSourcePorts**](NetworkProtectRuleSourcePorts.md) |  |
**destination_ports** | [**NetworkProtectRuleDestinationPorts**](NetworkProtectRuleDestinationPorts.md) |  |
**action** | [**NetworkProtectRuleAction**](NetworkProtectRuleAction.md) |  |
**comment** | **String** | Optional rule metadata of 1 to 100 Unicode code points. It does not participate in traffic matching. Omit it to leave a rule without a comment; replacing rules with an item that omits it clears the stored comment. Omitting rules on PATCH preserves existing comments. Empty strings and null are rejected. | [optional]
