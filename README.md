```

## 🔒 Security

We've designed this server with multiple layers of security:

### 🛡️ Command Execution Security

- **🚫 No Shell Execution**: Commands run directly without shell interpretation
- **🏯 Process Isolation**: Direct execution prevents command injection
- **✅ Argument Validation**: All inputs validated against dangerous patterns
- **📁 Path Security**: Directory traversal prevention

### 📊 Resource Limits

- Maximum command length: 50 characters
- Maximum argument length: 100 characters per argument
- Maximum flag name length: 50 characters
- Maximum flag value length: 500 characters
- Maximum file path length: 256 characters
- Maximum output size: 50KB (truncated if larger)
- Maximum JSON array items: 100 (truncated if larger)
- Command execution timeout: 30 seconds

### ⚠️ Dangerous Operation Protection

These commands require explicit human approval via `--user-reviewed` flag:
- `delete` - Removes resources
- `purge` - Clears cache
- `create` - Creates resources
- `update` - Modifies resources
- `activate` - Deploys changes
- `deactivate` - Disables services
- `upload` - Uploads packages

**Human Confirmation Required**: AI agents must:
1. Present the command to you for review
2. Wait for your explicit approval
3. Only then add the `--user-reviewed` flag

Example after human approval:
```json
{
  "tool": "fastly_execute",
  "arguments": {
    "command": "service",
    "args": ["delete"],
    "flags": [
      {"name": "service-id", "value": "abc123"},
      {"name": "user-reviewed"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 🚫 Blocked Commands

These commands are completely blocked for security:
- `auth-token` - Authentication token management
- `sso` - Single sign-on operations
- `profile` - Profile management

### 🛡️ Prompt Injection Protection

Comprehensive defenses against [prompt injection attacks](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/9/mcp-prompt-injection/):

- Command allowlisting prevents arbitrary execution
- Shell metacharacter blocking (`;`, `|`, `&`, `` ` ``, `$`, etc.)
- Tool definitions cannot be modified at runtime
- Output sanitization strips ANSI sequences
- Structured responses prevent hidden content

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Custom Command Allowlist

Override the default allowed commands using a file or inline specification:

#### From file:

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
fastly-mcp --allowed-commands-file /path/to/allowed-commands.txt
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
fastly-mcp.exe --allowed-commands-file C:\path\to\allowed-commands.txt
```

Format (see `example-allowed-commands.txt`):
- One command per line
- Lines starting with `#` are comments
- Empty lines ignored

#### Inline specification:

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
fastly-mcp --allowed-commands service,stats,version
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
fastly-mcp.exe --allowed-commands service,stats,version
```

- Comma-separated list of commands
- No spaces between commands (unless quoted)

#### Combining both sources:

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
# Merges commands from both file and inline list
fastly-mcp --allowed-commands-file base.txt --allowed-commands whoami,help
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Merges commands from both file and inline list
fastly-mcp.exe --allowed-commands-file base.txt --allowed-commands whoami,help
```

When both options are specified, commands from both sources are merged (union)

### PII Sanitization (Optional)

Remove sensitive data from outputs:

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
fastly-mcp --sanitize
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
fastly-mcp.exe --sanitize
```

What gets sanitized:
- API tokens and keys → `[REDACTED]`
- Email addresses → `u***@example.com`
- IP addresses → `[REDACTED-IP]`
- URLs with credentials → `https://[REDACTED-CREDENTIALS]@...`
- AWS/SSH keys → `[REDACTED-AWS-ACCESS-KEY]`
- JSON sensitive fields (password, secret, token)

⚠️ **Warning**: May redact service IDs and break automation workflows.

### Token Encryption (Optional)

Protect secrets from LLM exposure while maintaining functionality:

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
fastly-mcp --encrypt-tokens
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
fastly-mcp.exe --encrypt-tokens
```

How it works:
1. Detects hex tokens (32+ chars) and base64 secrets (20+ chars)
2. Encrypts using an ephemeral session key
3. Replaces with `[ENCRYPTED-TOKEN:xxxxx]` placeholders
4. Automatically decrypts when processing commands

### Combining Options

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
# All features with file-based allowlist
fastly-mcp --http --sanitize --encrypt-tokens --allowed-commands-file custom.txt

# All features with inline allowlist
fastly-mcp --http --sanitize --encrypt-tokens --allowed-commands service,stats,version

# HTTP with encryption and merged allowlists
fastly-mcp --http :9000 --encrypt-tokens --allowed-commands-file base.txt --allowed-commands whoami

# Testing with sanitization and inline commands
fastly-mcp --sanitize --allowed-commands service execute '{"command":"service","args":["list"]}'
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# All features with file-based allowlist
fastly-mcp.exe --http --sanitize --encrypt-tokens --allowed-commands-file custom.txt

# All features with inline allowlist
fastly-mcp.exe --http --sanitize --encrypt-tokens --allowed-commands service,stats,version

# HTTP with encryption and merged allowlists
fastly-mcp.exe --http :9000 --encrypt-tokens --allowed-commands-file base.txt --allowed-commands whoami

# Testing with sanitization and inline commands (note escaped quotes)
fastly-mcp.exe --sanitize --allowed-commands service execute '{\"command\":\"service\",\"args\":[\"list\"]}'
```

## 🤖 Model Recommendations

This server works best with Language Models optimized for:
- **Tool use and computer interaction**: Function calling and API interactions
- **Extended reasoning**: Enhanced thinking and planning capabilities
- **Structured output generation**: Well-formatted JSON and schema following

For best results, use models specifically optimized for agentic workflows and tool usage.

**Recommended Models**: 
- **Microsoft's MAI-DS-R1**: An excellent choice for use with the Fastly MCP server. It's open, free, and performs very well with MCP interactions and tool usage.
- **jan-nano-128k**: A small model that can run locally and works well with the MCP server. Ideal for users who want to run everything on their own hardware without relying on cloud services.

**Note**: At the time of writing, we do not recommend Gemini models as they are not optimized for tool usage and MCP interactions.

## 🔌 Custom AI Integration

For custom applications:

```python
import subprocess
import json

# Start the MCP server
process = subprocess.Popen(
    ['fastly-mcp'],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True
)

# Send a command
request = {
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
        "name": "fastly_list_commands"
    }
}
process.stdin.write(json.dumps(request) + '\n')
process.stdin.flush()

# Read response
response = json.loads(process.stdout.readline())
```

## 📜 License

MIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Built on the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) specification
- Uses [mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go) library for MCP implementation
- Wraps the official [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/cli/)

## Appendix: Recommended AI Assistant Prompt

When integrating the Fastly MCP server with an AI assistant, we recommend using this concise system prompt for optimal results:

```
You have access to Fastly's CDN/edge platform via MCP tools that wrap the Fastly CLI.

#### Tools:
- **`fastly_list_commands`** - List available commands
- **`fastly_describe [command]`** - Get command details/parameters
- **`fastly_execute`** - Run commands with parameters
- **`current_time`** - Get timestamps

#### Core Operations:
- **Services**: Create/update/list CDN services, manage versions
- **Edge Config**: VCL, ACLs, dictionaries, Compute
- **Content**: Backends, domains, caching, purging
- **Security**: TLS, secrets, access controls
- **Monitoring**: Stats, logs, alerts

#### Critical Rules:
1. **ALWAYS use `fastly_describe` before executing any unfamiliar command**
2. **Destructive operations require `--user-reviewed: true`** flag after human approval:
   - `delete`, `remove`, `purge`, `create`, `update` commands
   - Always explain impact and get human confirmation first
3. **Use `--json` format** for parsing
4. **Most commands need `--service-id`**
5. **Clone versions before changes**
6. Use `current_time` before operations that need timestamps

#### Workflow:

~~~
# Discover
fastly_describe command="service list"

# Execute (safe)
fastly_execute command="service list" parameters={"format": "json"}

# Execute (destructive - needs human review)
fastly_execute command="cache purge" parameters={
  "service-id": "ABC123",
  "key": "/api/*",
  "user-reviewed": true
}
~~~

#### Constraints:
- 30s timeout, 50KB output limit
- No shell features (pipes/redirects)
- Auth management blocked
- Never execute commands without first understanding them via describe

**Priority**: Explain command impacts clearly. Production changes need explicit human approval.
```

The recommended role definition (for example to configure a dedicated mode in Roo Code) is `You are an expert in using, interpreting, optimizing and configuring the Fastly CDN services.`
